# AI-Q-Learning

<h3> Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself? </h3>
<p> For this project, the initial code that was given to me created logic behind the game for the intelligent agent to complete, in addition to the logic for winning, losing, and recording game history. I created the code that makes the intelligent agent play the game, assigned the parameters for the learning algorithm, determined wins and losses, logged the history of games, and produced the output to relay results. </p>

<h3>Connection to the larger field of computer science: </h3> 
<p> Like artificial intelligence as a subject, the field of computer science is constantly changing. Learning new programs, libraries, and languages is essential in staying up-to-date with the current and emerging trends in the field. </p>

<h3>What do computer scientists do and why does it matter? </h3>
<p> Computer scientists are responsible for the logic and frameworks behind software applications and hardware components. They go a step further than simply coding; computer scientists identify and analyze ways to make programs accomplish tasks and run faster and more efficiently. </p>

<h3>How do computer scientists approach problems? </h3>
<p> Approaching problems in computer science can occur in various ways; there are "brute force" tactics, where getting a job done initially is the most important element, regardless of efficiency. Once a program accomplishes a task, optimizing for computing power and time becomes the next level of thinking. </p>

<h3>What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?</h3>
<p> Regarding AI, it is imperative that computer scientists are sensitive to biases and information-gathering tactics. AI is only as efficient as its input, so it is easy to gather and store more information than needed to ensure optimized results. This is a slippery slope that must be kept in mind while developing and maintaining such programs. </p>
